## Module 4 User Authentication

## AAA Security Services to satisfy CIA requirements

- AAA Functions used for many mechanisms:
  - Encryption
  - OS Security
  - Network Security
  - Web Security
  - Application security

### Authentication

- Identity: prove who you are who you claim to be

- Message

### Authorization (Access Control)

- What you are permitted to do after you are authroized.

### Accounting (accountability)

- Security

## The Authentication Problem

- Identity needs to be verified

  - Provides access to resources & prevents spoofing

## Basic Factors for User Authentication

### Something I know: Passwords

- **Entropy**: Measured by the number of bits of randomness, like a key.

- For large entropy passwords, we need lots of rules.

- 77 bits is a good amount of entropy for a good password.

### Something I have: tokens

- Authentication based on physical possession

- Combined w/ password/PIN for two-factor auth.

### Something I am: Static biometrics

- USed for high & low security apps

### Something I do: dynamic biometrics

## THe Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)

- Use two or more authentication factors to improve security

## bcrypt, scrypt

- Has hwith salt schemes for passwords and focus on making it expensive with "proof of work"

### bcrypt

- Passwords up to 55 characters

- 128 but random saly

- Hashing passwords, you want to be slow because attackers will be slowed down

### scrypt

## Salt vs Unsalted Passwords

### Unsalted passwords

- Same passwords map to the same hashes

- Poor design because a hacker just needs to go through it once...

### Salting Password

- Add some randomization to every password, so that the same password are mapped to different hashings.
