# Module 8: Web Security

## Frame-Based isolation is central to broswer security

- Each frame has an origin

  - Protocol: HTTP . HTTPS
  - Host: Host name (e.g. `google`)
  - Port: HTTP (`80` ) & HTTPS (`442`)

- Frame can only interact with its

## Same-Origin Policy (SOP)

- **Purpose**: Two pages from different sources should not be allowed to intefere with each other

## Challenges with same-origin policy

- Problems with the policy being too narrow

  - Difficult to get `login.calpoly.edu` and `xyz.calpoly.edu` to exchange data

  - **Solution**: Set the document.domain to the shared domain name to allow sites w/ different subdomains to interact.

- Prolmbs with the policy being too broad

## Sessions & Cookies

- **Cookies** are used by the server to implement sessions

- **Goal**: Server keeps a set of data related to the user's current session

- Browser sends cookies back to the same host by default.

- Can share cookies around the same domain

## Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

- An XSS vulnerability is present when

  - An can inject n
    EX: Malicious Javascript

### Stored XSS Attack

- Database

1. Attcker Injects script on to the web server

2. Victim client user requests content to web server

3. Web server sends malicious script to the victim client user

4. The victim client user sends the attacker valuable data

### Reflected XSS

-

1. Victim client accidentally visits attack server website

2. Attack server receives malicious link w/ script

3. Victim client user clicks on link and goes to the victim server

4. The victim server echoes user input (the attack) to the victim client

5. Victim client Sends valuable data to the atatck server

### XSS Server-side defenses

- Input validation & filtering

  - Never trust client-side data

  - Only allow what you expect

  - Anything being stored in a database needs to be input validated.

- Output control

  - HttpOnly cookie attribute to prevent cookie from being read from JS

  - Encoding - replace HTML control characters

- Static analysis - check server code for vulnerabilities

### XSS client-side defenses

- **Proxy**: Check for & eliminate HTML characters

- **Application firewall**: Check sites for potentially shady links

- **Auditing**: Monitor execution to JS to look for known misbehavior

# Cross-Site Request Forgery

- Popular attacks relevant to implicity getting access to cookies

## CSRF

- An attack that tricks the user to execute unwanted actions on a web app in which they are currently authenticated.

-

### CSRF Defenses

- Immplement XSS defenses first

- User interaction-based protection

  - Ask the user to re-enter their credentials for important actions

- **CSRF Token**:

  - A randomly generated token generated from the server

    - Secret and unique per user session

  - Make sure this token is turned on when you are handling sensitive information

-

#### SameSite cookie attribute
