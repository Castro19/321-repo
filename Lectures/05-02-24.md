# Access Control

## Principle of Least Privilege

- A major part of access control

- Only grant the minimal amount of access privileges

  - Difficult to do this in practice
  - Minimize the protection domain
  - Each subject has minimal rights

- Breaches occur where too much access has been granted

## Access Control Policy

- Who can access what?

- Determine what access rights (authorizations) a subject has for a set of objects

## Subjects, Objects, and Access Rights

### Subjects

- Entity capable of accessing object

  - EX: Owner, group, user, and other

### Object

- Resource to which access is controlled via access rights

  - Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD), Execute, etc.

## AWS

### How IAM Works

- Starts with subjects (users) and they authenticate

- Subjects make a request on some action (e.g. S3 Bucket)

  - An action is an API call

- Ask if thet are authorized in two parts

  a. Identity Based policies: For a given identity, what api HTTP method are they allowed to do. - What resource can you access
  b. Resource Based policies: For a given resource, what identity can go to it. - Do the act

  - Works both ways

- Manage the action or operation if you have access to do the action

- **Resource**: The act

### Users in AWS

- Identities can be users, groups, roles, or applications
