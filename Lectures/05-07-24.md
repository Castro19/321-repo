# Module 6: Malicious Software

## Viruses Phases and Classification

### Phases

- Dormant
- Propogation
- Triggering:
- Execution: Encrypt all your files

### Virus classification by Target

- Boot sector infector: Still there on your machine after you reboot it.

- File infector: most common

### Virus Classification by concealment & mutation

- **Polymorphic**: Evasion baseed variable encryption key

- **Metamorphic**: Evasion based on code rewrite

  - Self modifying code is different in every single copy by a slight amount

  - Not exactly the same code so it doesn't match to the same hash

### Propagation - Worms

- Like virus but are self-replicating

- Allows for:
  - Rapid Infection: Happens so fast it is hard to delete it
  - DDoS Attacks:

### Trojan Horses

- Involves social engineering

- A program containing hidden code which can perform unwanted or harmful function

### Malware Payloads

- The thing that contains the damage to run the malware

### Logic Bombs & Backdoors

- Code inseted by an insider that fires under certain logic

  - Logic bomb triggers on system conditions (e.g. executes after quitting a month after)

  - Backdoor triggers externally

## Vulnerabilities

### Out-of-bounds write

- Writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer

- Caused by type safety failure

### Stack-based Buffer Overflow

1. Smash the stack

2. Exploit local variables

3. Re-write return address

4. Do whatever you want

### ShellCode

- Machine code inserted by attacker saved via buffer overflow

- Metasploit
